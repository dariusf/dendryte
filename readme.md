Dendryte
---------

A dendrite is a tree-like structure in the human brain responsible for the transmission of electrochemical stimulation - in other words, _thought_.

Our project is a thinking tool in the same vein - a lightweight and portable web app which captures ideas in the form of mind maps.

### Instructions

- `git clone`
- Launch index.html

### Mind Maps

- Double-click anywhere on the canvas to create a node. Nodes can hold text of any sort.
- Click on nodes to select them. Selected nodes can be dragged around, linked to others, or deleted.
- Double-click on a node to _enter_ it - inside each node is a space which can contain other nodes. Drop nodes into other nodes to create elaborate hierarchies. Your mind maps can be made endlessly _deep_ in this way.
- The breadcrumb may help you to find your bearings. Failing that, the `up` button gets you out of recursive tangles.

### Upcoming Features

- Database-backed saving and loading
- Importing files
- Exports
- Node customization
- Better UI and aesthetic
